The foremost reason that happiness is so hard to achieve is that the universe was not designed with the comfort of human beings in mind. It is almost immeasurably huge, and most of it is hostilely empty and cold. It is the setting for great violence, as when occasionally a star explodes, turning to ashes everything within billions of miles. The rare planet whose gravity field would not crush our bones is probably swimming in lethal gases. Even planet Earth, which can be so idyllic and picturesque, is not to be taken for granted. To survive on it men and women have had to struggle for millions of years against ice, fire, floods, wild animals, and invisible microorganisms that appear out of nowhere to snuff us out. Frustration is deeply woven into the fabric of life. And whenever some of our needs are temporarily met, we immediately start wishing for more. This chronic dissatisfaction is the second obstacle that stands in the way of contentment. To deal with these obstacles, every culture develops with time protective devices—religions, philosophies, arts, and comforts—that help shield us from chaos. They help us believe that we are in control of what is happening and give reasons for being satisfied with our lot. But these shields are effective only for a while; after a few centuries, sometimes after only a few decades, a religion or belief wears out and no longer provides the spiritual sustenance it once did. “The universe is not hostile, nor yet is it friendly,” in the words of J. H. Holmes. “It is simply indifferent.” Chaos is one of the oldest concepts in myth and religion. It is rather foreign to the physical and biological sciences, because in terms of their laws the events in the cosmos are perfectly reasonable. For instance, “chaos theory” in the sciences attempts to describe regularities in what appears to be utterly random. But chaos has a different meaning in psychology and the other human sciences, because if human goals and desires are taken as the starting point, there is irreconcilable disorder in the cosmos.

To perfect a life-style capable of balancing harmoniously human goals with the resources of the environment is as rare a feat as building one of the great cathedrals that fill visitors with awe.

But when one understands that enjoyment depends on increasing complexity, it is no longer possible to take such radical relativism seriously. The quality of experience of people who play with and transform the opportunities in their surroundings, as Joe did, is clearly more developed as well as more enjoyable than that of people who resign themselves to live within the constraints of the barren reality they feel they cannot alter.

Why do I  speak to you from exile?  Because a Negro community in the South took up guns  in  self-defense  against racist violence-and used them.  I  am  held responsible for this  action, that for the first time in history American Negroes have armed themselves as a group to defend their homes, their wives, their children, in a situation  where  law and  order  had  broken  down,  where  the  authorities  could  not,  or  rather  would  not,  enforce  their  duty  to protect Americans from a lawless  mob.  I  accept this  responsibility  and  am  proud  of  it.  I  have asserted  the  right  of  Negroes  to  meet  the  violence  of  the  Ku  Klux  Klan  by  armed self-defense-and  have  acted  on  it.  It  has  always  been  an  accepted  right  of Americans,  as  the  history of  our Western  states proves, that where the law is  unable,  or unwilling, to  enforce order, the citizens can, and must, act in self-defense  against  lawless  violence.  I  believe  this  right  holds  for black  Americans as well as whites.
